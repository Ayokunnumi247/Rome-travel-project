        <h2>Why Rome?</h2> 
        <h3>Rome, the Eternal City</h3>
         <p> Rome has been a center of culture, art, and religion for centuries. As the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church and the home of the Vatican, it has been a significant spiritual center for Christianity, further cementing its status as an eternal city.
        </p>
        <p> The term "Eternal City" has been used by poets and writers since ancient times. Roman poets like Virgil and Ovid referred to the city in ways that emphasized its timeless nature. Later, during the Renaissance, the idea of Rome as an eternal city was revived and romanticized.
